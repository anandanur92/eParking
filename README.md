# eParking
/********************* Android Project *******************/

Parking has been the serious social and technical problem since the early day’s rapid 
increase in the number of vehicles in Thimphu and Phuentsholing town.  “If an individual
car requires an average time of 10 minutes for getting a parking slot daily. 
Considering his/her speed to be 10 kmph, he/she travels approximately 1.67 kilo meters and wastes 47 ml 
of fuel daily assuming mileage to be 21kmpl. With this information the individual basically wastes about
2.38 litres of fuel costing approximately Nu.154 per month, just to look for a car park. This scenario
would speak of adding about 5.6kg of CO2 per month individually considering the carbon dioxide emission 
to be 2.36 kg per litre of petrol. Further, this also increases the traffic congestion thereby increasing 
the CO2 emission collectively”.

Thus, in this proposal, we present the issues related to the car parking and 
its suggested solution. Our main aim and objectives and its key necessary and expected outputs are defined in 
the scope. Moreover, the system overview, time schedule and system overviews are discussed in this proposal.
In addition to this, the significance of the suggested solution in the real world are discussed briefly.
